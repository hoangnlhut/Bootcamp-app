    <h1>Chickens toi yeu em</h1>

    <p>
      The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a large and round
      short-winged bird, domesticated from the red junglefowl of Southeast Asia
      around 8,000 years ago.aaaa

      Most chickens are raised for food, providing meat and eggs; others are
      kept as pets[1] or for cockfighting. Chickens are common and widespread
      domestic animals, with a total population of 26.5 billion as of 2023, and
      an annual production of more than 50 billion birds. A hen bred for laying
      can produce over 300 eggs per year. There are numerous cultural references
      to chickens folklore, religion, and literature.

    <h2>Nomenclature</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Chicken can mean a chick, and this was historically the meaning of the
      word chicken,[16] as in William Shakespeare's play Macbeth, where Macduff
      laments the death of "all my pretty chickens and their dam".[17] The usage
      is preserved in placenames such as the Hen and Chicken Islands.[18] In
      older sources, and still often in trade and scientific contexts, chickens
      as a species are described as common fowl or domestic fowl.[19]

      Chickens are relatively large birds, active by day. The body is round, the
      legs are unfeathered in most breeds, and the wings are short.[20] Wild
      junglefowl can fly; chickens and their flight muscles are too heavy to
      allow them to fly more than a short distance.[21] Size and coloration vary
      widely between breeds.[20] Newly-hatched chicks of both modern and
      heritage varieties weigh the same, about 37 g (1.3 oz). Modern varieties
      however grow much faster; by day 35 a Ross 708 broiler may weigh 1.8 kg
      (4.0 lb) as against the 1.05 kg (2.3 lb) of a heritage chicken of the same
      age.[22]
