      <h1>Chickens toi yeu em</h1>

      <p>
        The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a large and round
        short-winged bird, domesticated from the red junglefowl of Southeast
        Asia around 8,000 years ago.aaaa
      </p>
      <p>
        Most chickens are raised for food, providing meat and eggs; others are
        kept as pets[1] or for cockfighting. Chickens are common and widespread
        domestic animals, with a total population of 26.5 billion as of 2023,
        and an annual production of more than 50 billion birds. A hen bred for
        laying can produce over 300 eggs per year. There are numerous cultural
        references to chickens folklore, religion, and literature.
      </p>
      <h2>Nomenclature</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Chicken can mean a chick, and this was historically the meaning of the
        word chicken,[16] as in William Shakespeare's play Macbeth, where
        Macduff laments the death of "all my pretty chickens and their dam".[17]
        The usage is preserved in placenames such as the Hen and Chicken
        Islands.[18] In older sources, and still often in trade and scientific
        contexts, chickens as a species are described as common fowl or domestic
        fowl.[19]
      </p>
      <h2>Description</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Voluptatum,
        obcaecati fugit excepturi possimus, itaque tenetur similique non

      <p>
        Chickens are relatively large birds, active by day. The body is round,
        the legs are unfeathered in most breeds, and the wings are short.[20]
        Wild junglefowl can fly; chickens and their flight muscles are too heavy
        to allow them to fly more than a short distance.[21] Size and coloration
        vary widely between breeds.[20] Newly-hatched chicks of both modern and
        heritage varieties weigh the same, about 37 g (1.3 oz). Modern varieties
        however grow much faster; by day 35 a Ross 708 broiler may weigh 1.8 kg
        (4.0 lb) as against the 1.05 kg (2.3 lb) of a heritage chicken of the
        same age.[22]

      <p>
        Several species of salamander inhabit the temperate rainforest of the
        Pacific Northwest, including the Ensatina, the Northwestern Salamander
        and the Rough-skinned Newt. Most salamanders are nocturnal, and hunt for
        insects, worms and other small creatures.
